    <h2>One Pot Alfredo Pasta</h2>
    <p>It can be paired with fresh veggies, like roasted asparagus, or topped with juicy grilled chicken.  The best part of all is how you can have this restaurant-worthy pasta from pan to plate in just 15 minutes!</p>
    <p>I am a huge fan of one-pot meals. Anytime I can serve a delicious meal and spare myself time cleaning up after is a total win for me. Another huge plus is the fact that everyone in my family loves fettuccine Alfredo pasta.  Sometimes it is hard to find a meal that everyone will eat without a dozen special requests. That makes this recipe a total game-changer in my opinion.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth (or vegetable broth)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic minced (or 2 smaller cloves)</li>
        <li>8 ounces fettuccine (or pasta of your choice)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese freshly grated, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley finely chopped, for garnish</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab a deep sided skillet that's large enough to fit the fettuccine.</li>
        <li>Place the skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Add milk, chicken broth, butter, and garlic. Bring to simmer and stir until the butter is melted. Then add the pasta.</li>
        <li>Move the pasta around every 30 seconds or so until it is softened so it doesn't stick. This should take around 3 minutes. Once the pasta is softened, reduce the heat to medium and stir every couple of minutes.
        </li>
        <li>After another 6 minutes or so, the pasta should be almost cooked but there should still be liquid covering the base of the skillet. Add in the cream and parmesan and mix.</li>
        <li>Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes, until the sauce is thickened and the pasta is cooked.<p>*If you cook it too long and the sauce goes gluggy, add a splash of hot tap water, it will go back to being silky with a few tosses.</p></li>
        <li>Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, garnished with freshly grated parmesan and parsley!</li>
    </ol>
